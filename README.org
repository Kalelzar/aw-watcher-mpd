#+DESCRIPTION: An ActivityWatch watcher for the Music Player Daemon

Watches the currently playing song in MPD.
* How to install

Requires 'poetry'.

You can install 'poetry' via pip: ~pip install poetry~

To package your own package

#+begin_src bash
poetry build && pip install dist/aw_watcher_mpd-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
#+end_src

To install the latest version from github without cloning
~pip install git+https://github.com/Kalelzar/aw-watcher-mpd.git~

To install from a cloned version, cd into the directory and run ~poetry install~
to install inside an virtualenv.
If you want to install it system-wide it can be installed with ~pip install .~,
but that has the issue that it might not get the exact version of the
dependencies due to not reading the poetry.lock file.
